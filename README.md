# Codoffee-Library-Manager
Codoffee Library Manager also in Persian as "کاتب", is a software for controlling and managing a library!
It can list the members of library, controll the barrowed books and the timing of returning them and send messages and notifie members of library's actions.
Me and my friend wrote this program for our school's library and to digitalis the system of libraries in our school. It's the second program of Codoffee Starup(which dismissed in early 2020) and it runs completely on Python-PL.
